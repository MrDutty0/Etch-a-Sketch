# Etch-a-Sketch

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy. It allows users to draw on a virtual grid by hovering over the cells or clicking and dragging the mouse. The project was created as part of the curriculum of The Odin Project, an open-source web development course.

## Technologies Used

The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Grid Size Selection: Users can select the size of the grid by using a range input element. The default grid size is 16x16, but users can adjust it from a minimum of 10x10 to a maximum of 100x100.

- Color Selection: Users can choose a color for drawing by using the color picker input element. The selected color will be used to draw on the grid.

- Drawing Modes: The application provides three drawing modes:
  - Normal Mode: In this mode, the selected color will be used for drawing on the grid. Users can click and drag to draw.
  - Rainbow Mode: In this mode, each cell will be filled with a random color from a predefined rainbow color palette. The color changes as the user moves the cursor over the grid.
  - Darkening Mode: In this mode, each cell will gradually darken as the user hovers over it repeatedly. The darkness level increases with each hover.

- Fill Functionality: Users can fill a contiguous area of cells with the selected color by clicking on a cell and selecting the fill mode. This feature is similar to the "bucket fill" tool in graphic editing software.

- Clear Grid: Users can clear the entire grid by clicking the "Clear" button. This will remove all drawn content and reset the grid to its initial state.
